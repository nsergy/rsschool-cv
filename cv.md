## About me

I am 43 years old, I work as a leading engineer in a car service. The moment has come to change something in my life. My education and current job is related to IT, but my knowledge is still not enough to change jobs. Therefore, I decided to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development, which will allow me to change jobs in the future.
